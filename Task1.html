       <h2> <p  style =" background-color:#CC0066 ; color : pink">A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom,is the reproductive
             structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae).<p>

        consist of a few haploid cells which produce gametes.</p><p<h1 style ="background-color:Tomato ; color :

                  gametophyte is contain within the ovule. When pollen from the anther of a flower is deposited on the stigma, this is
                   called pollination.</p><p  style ="color :#790000"> Some flowersmay self-pollinate, producing seed using pollen from the same flower or a different
                    flower of the same plant,</p><p style ="color:powderblue; background-color:rgb(68, 0, 255)"> but others have mechanisms to prevent  self-pollination and rely on cross-pollination, 
                    when pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual
                     of the same species.</p></h2>
