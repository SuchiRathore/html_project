            <p>tree, woody plant that regularly renews its growth (perennial). Most plants classified as trees have a single
                self-supporting trunk containing woody tissues, and in most species the trunk produces secondary limbs, called branches.
                To many, the word tree evokes images of such ancient, powerful, and majestic structures as oaks and sequoias, the latter
                being among the most massive and longest-living organisms in the world. Although the majority of Earthâ€™s terrestrial 
                biomass is represented by trees, the fundamental importance of these seemingly ubiquitous plants for the very existence 
                and diversity of life on Earth is perhaps not fully appreciated</p>
