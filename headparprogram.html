<h1 style ="color:green;"> Earth </h1>
<p><h2 style = "color:blue;">Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only place known in the universe where life has origina
ted and found habitability. While Earth may not contain the largest volumes of water in the Solar System, only Earth 
sustains liquid surface water, extending over 70.8% of the planet with its ocean, making it an ocean world. The polar 
regions currently retain most of all other water with large sheets of ice covering ocean and land, dwarfing Earth's 
groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water.<br>
The other 29.2% of the Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands, and is widely covered by 
vegetation. Below the planet's surface lies the crust, consisting ofseveral slowly moving tectonic plates, which
interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes.</h2></P> 
<h2 style ="color: red;"> Flowers </h2>
<p><h3 style ="color : blue;">flower, the characteristic reproductive structure of angiosperms. As popularly used, the term “flower” especially 
applies when part or all of the reproductive structure is distinctive in colour and form.In their range of colour, 
size, form, and anatomical arrangement, flowers present a seemingly endless variety of combinations. They range in 
size from minute blossoms to giant blooms.<br> In some plants, such as poppy, magnolia, tulip, and petunia, each flower 
is relatively large and showy and is produced singly, while in other plants, such as aster, snapdragon, and lilac, 
the individual flowers may be very small and are borne in a distinctive cluster known as an inflorescence. <br>Regardless
of their variety, all flowers have a uniform function, the reproduction of the species through the production of 
seed.</h3></p>
<h3 style ="color:orange;"> Fruits </h3>
<p><h4 style = "color: blue;">fruit, the fleshy or dry ripened ovary of a flowering plant, enclosing the seed or seeds. Thus, apricots, bananas, and
 grapes, as well as bean pods, corn grains, tomatoes, cucumbers, and (in their shells) acorns and almonds, are all 
technically fruits. Popularly, however, the term is restricted to the ripened ovaries that are sweet and either 
succulent or pulpy. For treatment of the cultivation of fruits, see fruit farming. For treatment of the nutrient 
composition and processing of fruits, see fruit processing.<br>
Fruits are important sources of dietary fibre, vitamins (especially vitamin C), and antioxidants. Although fresh fruits are subject to spoilage, their shelf life can be extended by refrigeration or by the removal of oxygen from their storage or packaging containers. Fruits can be processed into juices, jams, and jellies and preserved by dehydration, canning, fermentation, and pickling. Waxes, such as those from bayberries (wax myrtles), and vegetable ivory from the hard fruits of a South American palm species (Phytelephas macrocarpa) are important fruit-derived products. Various
 drugs come from fruits, such as morphine from the fruit of the opium poppy.</h4></p>

<h4 style ="color : grey;"> Animals </h4>
<p>Animal, any of a group of multicellular eukaryotic organisms (i.e., as distinct from bacteria, 
their deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is contained in a membrane-bound nucleus). They are thought to have evolved 
independently from the unicellular eukaryotes. Animals differ from members of the two other kingdoms of multicellular
 eukaryotes, the plants (Plantae) and the fungi (Mycota), in fundamental variations in morphology and physiology. 
This is largely because animals have developed muscles and hence mobility, a characteristic that has stimulated the 
further development of tissues and organ systems.<br>

Animals dominate human conceptions of life on Earth not simply by their size, abundance, and sheer diversity but also
 by their mobility, a trait that humans share. So integral is movement to the conception of animals that sponges, 
which lack muscle tissues, were long considered to be plants. <br>Only after their small movements were noticed in 1765 
did the animal nature of sponges slowly come to be recognized.</p>
<h5 style ="color: grey;"> India</h5>
<p>India, country that occupies the greater part of South Asia. Its capital is New Delhi, built in the 20th century just
 south of the historic hub of Old Delhi to serve as India’s administrative centre. Its government is a constitutional 
republic that represents a highly diverse population consisting of thousands of ethnic groups and likely hundreds of 
languages. With roughly one-sixth of the world’s total population, India is the second most populous country, after 
China.<br>

It is known from archaeological evidence that a highly sophisticated urbanized culture—the Indus civilization—dominated
 the northwestern part of the subcontinent from about 2600 to 2000 BCE. From that period on, India functioned as a 
virtually self-contained political and cultural arena, which gave rise to a distinctive tradition that was associated 
primarily with Hinduism, the roots of which can largely be traced to the Indus civilization. Other religions, notably
 Buddhism and Jainism, originated in India—though their presence there is now quite small—and throughout the centuries
 residents of the subcontinent developed a rich intellectual life in such fields as mathematics, astronomy, 
architecture, literature, music, and the fine arts.</P>
<h6> Sports </h6>
<p>sports, physical contests pursued for the goals and challenges they entail. Sports are part of every culture past and 
present, but each culture has its own definition of sports. The most useful definitions are those that clarify the 
relationship of sports to play, games, and contests. “Play,” wrote the German theorist Carl Diem, “is purposeless 
activity, for its own sake, the opposite of work.” Humans work because they have to; they play because they want to. 
Play is autotelic—that is, it has its own goals. <br>
It is voluntary and uncoerced. Recalcitrant children compelled by their parents or teachers to compete in a game of 
football (soccer) are not really engaged in a sport. Neither are professional athletes if their only motivation is 
their paycheck. In the real world, as a practical matter, motives are frequently mixed and often quite impossible to 
determine.</p>
